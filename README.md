# tic-tac-toe
A simple CMD based tic tac toe game written in C.

KNOWN ISSUES:

1. Players can sometimes override their opponent's input
2. Junk input (0,10...) is considered invalid but ends the player's turn

FUTURE UPDATES:

1. Maximise code efficiency
2. Introduce infinite recursion so that the player can decide when to end the program
3. Process junk input without ending player's turn
4. ASCII text improvements
